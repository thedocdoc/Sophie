Mic is easily fooled by background noise, Likly will need to add some type of active filtering or noise canceling 

The mic is "hot" all the time so the robot is always lisening this is not ideal and I will need to find a good solution, perhaps a hotword/keyword like Google home does it. 
I do like that is is always avalible and not having a keyword is a more natural way to interact with the robot.

The Respeaker mic does a good job at picking up voices, but I may need to boost the incoming volume. May not be a problem after Jetpack update and drivers

Reduced* The robot hears itself so a implementaion of the mic muting will need to be done.

Fixed* The weather section is WIP and needs alot of TLC as it needs to be more fluid sounding and report in units I can understand, not that good at Kelvin as a temp. 

Fixed* There is a issue with the JSON files that vosk creates and or that I modify that break the program out of the loop:
JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 41 column 21 (char 867)

Fixed* The date being read back is a odd sounding format and should report the months as words not numbers.
