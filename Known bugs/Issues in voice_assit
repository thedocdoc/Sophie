There is a issue with the JSON files that vosk creates and or that I modify that break the program out of the loop:
JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 41 column 21 (char 867)

The mic is "hot" all the time so the robot is always lisening this is not ideal and I will need to find a good solution, perhaps a hotword/keyword like Google home does it. 

The current voice is based on a much better CMU female voice, however it is not as natural sounding as I'd like

The date being read back is a odd sounding format and should report the months as words not numbers.

The Respeaker mic does a good job at picking up voices but I may need to boost the incoming volume

The weather section is WIP and needs alot of TLC as it needs to be more fluid sounding and report in units I can understand, not that good at Kelvin as a temp.
